/**
 * The #GtkViewport widget acts as an adaptor class, implementing
 * scrollability for child widgets that lack their own scrolling
 * capabilities. Use GtkViewport to scroll child widgets such as
 * #GtkGrid, #GtkBox, and so on.
 * 
 * If a widget has native scrolling abilities, such as #GtkTextView,
 * #GtkTreeView or #GtkIconView, it can be added to a #GtkScrolledWindow
 * with gtk_container_add(). If a widget does not, you must first add the
 * widget to a #GtkViewport, then add the viewport to the scrolled window.
 * gtk_container_add() does this automatically if a child that does not
 * implement #GtkScrollable is added to a #GtkScrolledWindow, so you can
 * ignore the presence of the viewport.
 * 
 * The GtkViewport will start scrolling content only if allocated less
 * than the child widgetâ€™s minimum size in a given orientation.
 * 
 * # CSS nodes
 * 
 * GtkViewport has a single CSS node with name viewport.
