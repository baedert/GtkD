	 * guarantees for the drawing operation vary for different implementations
	 * of drawing, so a #GdkCairoContext and a #GdkGLContext need to be treated

	 * A call to this function is a requirement for drawing and must be followed
	 * by a call to gdk_draw_context_end_frame(), which will complete the
	 * drawing operation and ensure the contents become visible on screen.
	 *
	 * Note that the @region passed to this function is the minimum region that
	 * needs to be drawn and depending on implementation, windowing system and
	 * hardware in use, it might be necessary to draw a larger region. Drawing
	 * implementation must use gdk_draw_context_get_frame_region() to query the
	 * region that must be drawn.
	 *
	 * When using GTK+, the widget system automatically places calls to
	 * gdk_draw_context_begin_frame() and gdk_draw_context_end_frame() via the
	 * use of #GskRenderers, so application code does not need to call these
	 * functions explicitly.
